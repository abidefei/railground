<h1>Paths</h1>
<p>This layer defines the topology traversal and constructs the path within the topology.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Path</dt>
<dd>
  A Path is a sequence of Rail Segments linked via Rail Links (i.e. two Rail Segments belonging to the same Rail Element
  are not allowed within one Rail Path).
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Model</h2>

<h3>Carrier Sets</h3>

<dl>
<dt>PATH_ENUM</dt>
<dd>
  Enumeration of all defined Paths of the particular station.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Constants</h3>

<dl>
<dt>PATH_ELEM_POS : PATH_ENUM → (RAIL_ELEM ⇸ RAIL_POS_ENUM)</dt>
<dd>
  Rail Element Positions for all Rail Elements of every Paths of the particular station.
</dd>
<dt>PATH_SGMT_ALL : PATH_ENUM → ℙ(RAIL_SGMT)</dt>
<dd>
  All Rail Segments of every Path of the particular station.
</dd>
<dt>PATH_CTOR_BEG : PATH_ENUM → RAIL_CTOR</dt>
<dd>
  Begin Rail Connector of all Paths of the particular station.
</dd>
<dt>PATH_CTOR_END : PATH_ENUM → RAIL_CTOR</dt>
<dd>
  End Rail Connector of all Paths of the particular station.
</dd>
<dt>PATH_SGMT_FST : PATH_ENUM → RAIL_SGMT</dt>
<dd>
  First Rail Segment of all Paths of the particular station.
</dd>
<dt>PATH_SGMT_LST : PATH_ENUM → RAIL_SGMT</dt>
<dd>
  Last Rail Segment of all Paths of the particular station.
</dd>
<dt>PATH_SGMT_NXT : PATH_ENUM → (RAIL_SGMT ⤔ RAIL_SGMT)</dt>
<dd>
  Next Rail Segment of all Paths of the particular station.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<dl>
<dt><em>RAIL_ELEM_POS_CURR : RAIL_ELEM → RAIL_POS_ENUM</em></dt>
<dd>
  <em>Inherited.</em>
</dd>
<dt>PATH_CURR : ℙ(PATH_ENUM)</dt>
<dd>
  Current Paths.
</dd>
<dt>RAIL_ELEM_PATH_CURR : RAIL_ELEM ⇸ PATH_CURR</dt>
<dd>
  Current Path the particular Rail Element belongs to. The type of this variable already assures, that one element
  belongs to at most one current path. 
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Events</h3>

<dl>
<dt>set_RAIL_ELEM_POS_CURR : (RAIL_ELEM, RAIL_POS_ENUM) <em>«refines» set_RAIL_ELEM_POS_CURR</em></dt>
<dd>
  Refinement: Only Rail Elements, which do not belong to any Current Path may be set to new position.
</dd>
<dt>add_PATH_CURR : (PATH_ENUM)</dt>
<dd>
  Add a new Path.
</dd>
<dt>rem_PATH_CURR : (PATH_ENUM)</dt>
<dd>
  Remove an existing Path.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Invariants</h3>

<ul>
<li>Elements of the current path correspond to the elements of defined paths.</li>
<li>Elements of all current paths are in required position.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
Simple example with one track and two points as well as two terminators on both ends:

                   i j
               ----*+*----
              /           \
   *+*-----*+*-----*+*-----*+*
   a b     c d     e f     g h
  X1    T       P1      P2   X2

* partition(PATH, {R1}, {R2}, {R3}, {R4})
* PATH_ELEM_POS = {
    R1 ↦ {T ↦ RAIL_POS_F, P1 ↦ RAIL_POS_R, P2 ↦ RAIL_POS_L},
    R2 ↦ {T ↦ RAIL_POS_F, P1 ↦ RAIL_POS_L, P2 ↦ RAIL_POS_R},
    R3 ↦ {T ↦ RAIL_POS_F, P1 ↦ RAIL_POS_R, P2 ↦ RAIL_POS_L},
    R4 ↦ {T ↦ RAIL_POS_F, P1 ↦ RAIL_POS_R, P2 ↦ RAIL_POS_L}
}
* PATH_SGMT_ALL = {
	R1 ↦ {bc, de, fg},
	R2 ↦ {bc, di, jg},
	R3 ↦ {gf, ed, cb},
	R4 ↦ {gj, id, cb},
}
* PATH_CTOR_BEG = {R1 ↦ b, R2 ↦ b, R3 ↦ g, R4 ↦ g}
* PATH_CTOR_END = {R1 ↦ g, R2 ↦ g, R3 ↦ b, R4 ↦ b}
* PATH_SGMT_FST = {R1 ↦ bc, R2 ↦ bc, R3 ↦ gf, R4 ↦ gj}
* PATH_SGMT_LST = {R1 ↦ fg, R2 ↦ jg, R3 ↦ cb, R4 ↦ cb}
* PATH_SGMT_NXT = {R1 ↦ {bc ↦ de, de ↦ fg}, R2 ↦ {bc ↦ di, di ↦ jg}, R3 ↦ {gf ↦ ed, ed ↦ cb}, R4 ↦ {gj ↦ id, id ↦ cb}}

Note that the R1 and R3 as well as R2 and R4 consist of the same elements in the same position, which are used in the
opposite direction. The differentiation can not be made based on the elements and their positions, rather based on the
used segments.
