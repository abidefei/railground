<h1>Rails</h1>
<p>This layer defines the rail entities and constructs the railway topology thereof.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Rail Element</dt>
<dd>
  A Rail Element is a unit which provides a physical running path for the trains, i.e. rails (e.g. track, point,
  crossing).
</dd>
<dt>Rail Terminator</dt>
<dd>
  A Rail Terminator is a pseudo unit used on the topology boundary.
</dd>
<dt>Rail Item</dt>
<dd>
  Rail Item is a common name for a Rail Element or a Rail Terminator.
  <em>Note: Rail Item is not explicitly modeled.</em>
</dd>
<dt>Rail Connector</dt>
<dd>
  A Rail Connector is a port of a Rail Item used to define the element's connectivity via Rail Segments as well as to
  link this element with the adjacent ones via Rail Links. A Rail Element has usually 2..4 Rail Connectors (depending
  on the element type), a Rail Terminator has only one Rail Connector. Each Rail Connector belongs to exactly one Rail
  Item (Rail Element or Rail Terminator).
</dd>
<dt>Rail Link</dt>
<dd>
  A Rail Link is a link from a Rail Connector of some Rail Item to a Rail Connector belonging to the (in topological
  sense) adjacent Rail Item. Each Rail Connector is bidirectionally linked (via two Rail Links in opposite direction)
  with exactly one Rail Connector belonging to some other Rail Item.
</dd>
<dt>Rail Segment</dt>
<dd>
  A Rail Segment is a connection from a Rail Connector of some Rail Element to another Rail Connector of the same Rail
  Element. A Rail Terminator has only one Rail Connector and therefore doesn`t provide any Rail Segments.
</dd>
<dt>Rail Element Connectivity</dt>
<dd>
  A Rail Element Connectivity is a collection of Rail Segments offered by one Rail Element at any point in time. A Rail
  Element may offer several Rail Element Connectivities (at different points in time). Each Rail Connectivity may leave
  some (or even all) Rail Element Connectors unconnected. However, each Rail Element Connector must be involved in at
  least one Rail Element Connectivity of that Rail Element. For all Rail Element Connectivities of every Rail Element
  holds, that each Rail Connector of that Rail Element is bidirectionally connected (via two Rail Segments in opposite
  direction) with at most one other Rail Connector belonging to the same Rail Element. A Rail Terminator doesn`t provide
  any connectivity. <em>Note: This model doesn't cover elements with distinct direction like trailable points.</em>
</dd>
<dt>Fixed Rail Element</dt>
<dd>
  A Fixed Rail Element is a Rail Element which provides one Rail Element Connectivity only (which, however, may comprise
  more Rail Segments). This Rail Element Connectivity must not be empty, i.e. must involve at least one Rail Segment.
</dd>
<dt>Movable Rail Element</dt>
<dd>
  A Movable Rail Element is a Rail Element which provides several Rail Element Connectivities, one of them being empty,
  i.e. not containing any Rail Segments (disconnected).
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  The Railway Topology Formal Model representation is based on double vertex graph. The vertices represent the element
  connectors and the edges the segments within the elements. Two linked vertices of adjacent elements build the
  double-vertex. The railway elements themselves are not contained in the graph, but are derived from the element
  connectors as each connector belongs to one element.

               ----*+*----
              /           \

   a b     c d     e f     g h

  X1    T       P1      P2   X2

Rail connectors are represented by *
Rail Link pairs (both directions) are represented by +
