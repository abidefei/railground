railground
==========
This is a playground for studying railway models using formal methods.

rg-model - the original railground model produced by Thales

rg-altStyles - similar to rg-model but explores some alternative styles of modelling at a detailed expression level - Soton
rg-altRefmt - follows a different refinement sequence starting from a different abstraction (paths) - Soton
rg-iumlb - as rg-altRefmt but using iUML-B - Soton
